# in supervised learning we have data present (a lot of it) and we make predictions or teach a machine using that data
# now there ca be different sets of problem

#classification problem
#it generally consists of outputs ranging from 0 and 1, yes No etc
#more can be there like male female gay bi homo so the basic need is we are required to classify the input by using
#existig info

Another Class of problem is Regression Problems
in this the Machine has to predict what the output should be based on the problem
 for example
 how many chccolates will i sell in next month
  the output would be a number based on the history of data present and i think you get it?? right??

So supervised here makes sense
as we are gven a data set and already know our correct output should look like

#UNSUPERVISED LEARINING

'''
in unsupervised learning we have the data but the data is unlabelled so its the machines job to form classes
for example
if many features are present then based on it they will hold positions and its computers (algos) job to distinguish
between them and form classes

The technique here is called Clustring and is used by fb(people you may know) ads , clustring or grouping of same type of news by googleetc


 anothertype of problem or solution is cocktail party problem
